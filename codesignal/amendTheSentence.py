'''
You have been given a string s, which is supposed to be a sentence. However, someone forgot to put spaces between the different words, and for some reason they capitalized the first letter of every word. Return the sentence after making the following amendments:

Put a single space between the words.
Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.
Example

For s = "CodesignalIsAwesome", the output should be
amendTheSentence(s) = "codesignal is awesome";
For s = "Hello", the output should be
amendTheSentence(s) = "hello"
