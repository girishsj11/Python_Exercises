### circle_area.py

  Write a python program which accept the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
  
### counting_vowels.py

  Write a function which takes as an input string s and returns the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, 
or u) that occur in the string.

### comma_separated_list_tuples.py
    
    Write a Python Program which accepts a sequence of comma separated numbers from user and generate a list and tuple with those numbers.

### file_extension.py
    
    WAP which accepts a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
  
### sorting_dict_by_value.py

    Write a python script to sort a dictionary by value.
  
### merge_2_dict.py

    Write a python script to merge two dictionaries.
  
### password_verification.py

    Write a python function to check a password whether it is good or not? A good password is atleast 8 characters long and contains an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and a number.
  
### integer_collection.py

    Read a collection of integers from the user. Display all negative integers, followed by all the zeros, followed by all the positive integers.

### swap_without_temp.py

    WAP to swap two numbers without using temporary variable. (Hint Use data structures)
    
### noise_level.py

    The following table lists the sound level in decibels for several common noises.
    
    Noise Decibel level (dB)
    Jackhammer 130
    Gas lawnmower 106
    Alarm clock 70
    Quiet room 40
    
    
    Write a python program that reads a sound level in decibels from the user. If the user enters a 
    decibel level that matches one of the noises in the table then your program should display a 
    message containing only that noise. If the user enters a number of decibels between the noises 
    listed then your program should display a message indicating which noises the level is between. 
    Ensure that your program also generates reasonable output for a value smaller than the quietest 
    noise in the table, and for a value larger than the loudest noise in the table.
