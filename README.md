## Programs Motive


## ***Program1.py***

   Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list



## ***Program2.py***

   Convert two equal length lists into a dictionary


## ***Program3.py***

   **Leetcode :- First Program**
   
   Given an array of integers nums and and integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.You can return the answer in any order.
 
>Examples:

     Example 1:
        Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
        Output: [0,1]
        Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
     Example 2:
        Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
        Output: [1,2]
     Example 3:
        Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
        Output: [0,1]
 
>Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.


## ***Program4.py***

   competition between user & system generated numbers to conculde who's winner among the random numbers which generates by user , system .
   
   
## ***Program5.py***

   Program is to display least/minimum number which randomly generated by a system . 
   
   
## ***Program6.py***

   Program will display the count of value which is present in a list/array.
   
## ***Program7.py***

   **Program motive :-** There is a saying that "Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data." Let's see if you can write a function to help clean US zip code data. Given a string, it should return whether or not that string represents a valid zip code. For our purposes, a valid zip code is any string consisting of exactly 5 digits.

## ***outlook_mail_send_automation***
   **Program motive :-** Sending an automatic mail via outlook app in windows platform

   **Pre-requisite things :**
   - outlook application with email id
 
   **Program execution :** 
   - dispatching the outlook application
   - create items based on request 
   - make the receiver id (To item)
   - have the subject line for the mail initiation 
   - Write the body for the mail automation 
   - if needed any attachment you can add it 
   - then final option is to send 


## ***Masking_user_password***
   **Program motive :-** Mask the user password which user enters on screen
   
   **Pre-requisite things :**
   - pip install getpass
   - pip install stdiomask
   
   **Program Description :**
   - Masking the user password we have 2 methods which can be implemented by using the 2 packages/modules :
     * getpass
       - Where getpass module will not echo's any password which being entered by user.
     * stdiomask
       - Where stdiomask will prompts the user password as asterix or '*'.
