## Programs Motive


## ***Program1.py***

   Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list



## ***Program2.py***

   Convert two equal length lists into a dictionary


## ***Program3.py***

   **Leetcode :- First Program**
    Given an array of integers nums and and integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.


## ***Program5.py***

   competition between user & system generated numbers to conculde who's winner among the random numbers which generates by user , system .
   
   
## ***Program6.py***

   Program is to display least/minimum number which randomly generated by a system . 
   
   
## ***Program7.py***

   Program will display the count of value which is present in a list/array.
